# 11/13/17: 
* Program writing began. 
# 11/14/17: 

* Revised the Ciphersuite
* Made edits to How Base64 Encoded data is used.
* Added the possibility of hex verification.
* Began trying to Add AES Security.

# 11/15/17

* Fixed the Skeleton of the program
* Create key works now
* Got the Hex Generation feature working
* Annotated the heck out of it.
* AES wont come for a while now.
* Keys are in main code memory - Hex is in a direct
  Output from the Procedure.

# 11/16/17

* Slightly modifyed the key system
* AES Keys is a thing now
* Random block of memory serves as an 
  initialization vector now which is an added security measure.
* Moving over to Modular programming. It may help effeciency of writing code and sectioning off code
  because I'm horrible trying to keep things organized.. 
* Using Modular code actually makes the program faster! though, makes the program bigger...?
* Program compiles at around 265kb now.
* added third-party Networking modual to ease with the development of the code.
  I hate making networking loops...

# 11/17/17

* no progress, just thinking.

# 11/18/17

* Added new Folder to \Code: \Modules
* Edited some things in the Networking module to experiment with it.
* the example files work with the module so compile it and check it out!
