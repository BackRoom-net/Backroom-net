Decentralized file sharing network similar to the Torrent Network.

Basically where I (Noisy) want to go with this project is to-

1. Create a program where a Client can share files which will be Compressed and Encrypted all in one go.
   In addition, other clients throughout the network can connect and download the files.

2. The Clients will have their IP addresses secured but they will all link up to form a big network. 
   So, If one client connects to one that is connected to lots more, a Public address link can be shared.
   That brings about the possibility of a huge sharing interconnected secure file sharing network!

3. Have a little fun. I'm not doing this project for no reason or to gain profit! I'm quite new to Github!
   I would love to see what other people have to say about the project and maybe even work with some people!


Please request for Collaboration!
