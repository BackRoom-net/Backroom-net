# Backroom-net

Decentralized file sharing network similar to the Torrent Network.

![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)

Basically where I (Noisy) want to go with this project is to-

* Create a program where a Client can share files which will be Compressed and Encrypted all in one go.
   In addition, other clients throughout the network can connect and download the files.

* The Clients will have their IP addresses secured but they will all link up to form a big network. 
   So, If one client connects to one that is connected to lots more, a Public address link can be shared.
   That brings about the possibility of a huge sharing interconnected secure file sharing network!

* Have a little fun. I'm not doing this project for no reason, or to gain profit! I'm quite new to Github!
   I would love to see what other people have to say about the project and maybe even work with some people!

# New Features

> Program is currently in The developmet Alpha stage and Is **Not** working.

* Nodes can connect currently across local networks for testing a debugging.
* The database Actually works now for storing Node addresses and such. (They currently aren't encrypted - Alpha)
* Added A "ReceivedFiles" Directory that is for files currently being received.
* Working on getting a firm Network handshake between Nodes.

## Most Important New Features
* Application is about 20% Faster.
* New Logging system has higher Detail for debugging.
* Node system has been employed.


# Purebasic

> This program is being developed under PureBasic 5.61 and 5.62 (Windows 10 - x64)
> Current compatibility with the program is limited to windows 7,8,8.1 and 10 

# System Requirements

This program will run on most modern computers (1-3 years old)

_It is strict and **can** be annoying_

* System **Minimum** Memory is 2gb!!
  Nothing below this amount will run! This is like this so 32-bit computers can still run this program.
  
  > A memory Override version of the program is being worked on right now.
  > If your computer has less than 2gb of memory you may switch to this version and
  > there will be no visual differences to the program.
  
* System reccomended specifications are:

   **6Gb of ram**

   **Four Core processor** - *this does not mean Hyperthreaded fake cores.*

   **250Gb Hard disk space**

   **35 Megabit internet speed** - *Recommended 1000M NIC*
   
* System Minimum specifications are:

   **4Gb of ram** - *Yes, this program can work with less but, you will be prompted if you would like to risk it. The program will      however **Not** Run if it is Below 2gb. So, In fact, the minimum is 2Gb.*

   **Dual Core**

   **25Gb Hard disk space**

   **15 Megabit internet speed**

* System Notes

A 250Gb hard disk is reccomended just if you have it as a boot up drive, you will be encrypting files as well so that puts a strain on the drive and storage. In the Minimum, You will not be able to really have windows and have very many packages being received or encrypted/decrypted. it would be dangerous to do with a minimal amount of space.
For ram, it's going to be a ram hog (*Like Chrome*) and I will need to make many modifications to memory management quickly.
