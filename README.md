Basically where I (Noisy) want to go with this project is to-

* Create a program where a Client can share files which will be Compressed and Encrypted all in one go.
   In addition, other clients throughout the network can connect and download the files.

* The Clients will have their IP addresses secured but they will all link up to form a big network. 
   So, If one client connects to one that is connected to lots more, a Public address link can be shared.
   That brings about the possibility of a huge sharing interconnected secure file sharing network!

* Have a little fun. I'm not doing this project for no reason or to gain profit! I'm quite new to Github!
   I would love to see what other people have to say about the project and maybe even work with some people!
