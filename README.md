# Backroom-net

Decentralized file sharing network similar to the Torrent Network.

![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)

Basically where I (Noisy) want to go with this project is to-

* Create a program where a Client can share files which will be Compressed and Encrypted all in one go.
   In addition, other clients throughout the network can connect and download the files.

* The Clients will have their IP addresses secured but they will all link up to form a big network. 
   So, If one client connects to one that is connected to lots more, a Public address link can be shared.
   That brings about the possibility of a huge sharing interconnected secure file sharing network!

* Have a little fun. I'm not doing this project for no reason, or to gain profit! I'm quite new to Github!
   I would love to see what other people have to say about the project and maybe even work with some people!

# New Features

> Program is currently in The developmet Alpha stage and Is **Not** working.

* Program is being reworked. No new features will be announced until this is done.

## Most Important New Features
* A new streaming module is being worked on right now. This will allow files to be streamed across the network seamlessly. This also includes post compression of files. No encryption yet.
* New Logging system has higher Detail for debugging.
* If you choose to do a safe shutdown of the application, debug logs and the program database will be sent anonymously to my ftp server for analisis! 


# Purebasic

> This program is being developed under PureBasic 5.61 and 5.62 (Windows 10 - x64)
> Current compatibility with the program is limited to windows 7,8,8.1 and 10 

# System Requirements

**Because program is being reworked, these do not apply right now.**

This program will run on most modern computers (1-4 years old)

_It is strict and **can** be annoying_

* System **Minimum** Memory is 2gb!!
  Nothing below this amount will run! This is in place so 32-bit computers can still run this program.
  
  > A memory Override version of the program is being worked on right now.
  > If your computer has less than 2gb of memory you may switch to this version and
  > there will be no visual differences to the program.
  
* System reccomended specifications are:

   **6Gb of ram**

   **Four Core processor** - *this does not mean Hyperthreaded fake cores.*

   **250Gb Hard disk space**

   **35 Megabit internet speed** - *Recommended 1000M NIC*
   
* System Minimum specifications are:

   **4Gb of ram** - *Yes, this program can work with less but, you will be prompted if you would like to risk it. The program will      however **Not** Run if it is Below 2gb. So, In fact, the minimum is 2Gb.*

   **Dual Core**

   **25Gb Hard disk space**

   **15 Megabit internet speed**

# Further Development Ideas

Of course there will be Node address sharing which is when a new Node joins a group through an active connection, then the Host Node shares all of its addresses to this joining node.

In addition, there will be a command line extention to the program. I'm not quite sure what exactly It will do yet, But it will be nice for developers to have. Might be good for checking Current Node Status and other Nodes to see what their Uplink/DownLink statistics are.

I'm also open to Ideas. Its not like anyone is watching this project anyways.
