# All Contributors

Thank you For viewing the Guidelines, this will be summed up here in just a couple Bullets!

# Main Points

* Contribute meaningfully, 
  Please don't just contribute random lines of code to the project, Its kind of useless.
  Push and Pull guidelines are different so go check out those. Well.. If its useful, just write it explaining it to me 
  And It can Be sorted out. The smallest of Additions to the code could be the most useful.

* Email Me for help. (Or like through any other means.)
  If you have a question about the code that involves you wanting to improve it, just ask.
  I know sometimes I might not comment on code and it can get confusing.

Thats pretty much it.
