# Issues
 
Bugs happen in code. I understand this and any feedback is great!
However, Here are some things to think about when making an issue statement.

* Operating system
  Please include Your operating system in the issue statement so I can test and see if the Operating system is the problem.
  It shouldn't be, but the native OS For Backroom Is Win10(x64). If your Using Linux, I'm sorry but good luck. 

* Any Error Log?
  If so, Include it in the Issue report.

* Does an error Message Mention any Database or Data file?
  Check to see if the permissions in that folder didn't change and then Look to the line below.
  If Not, Send Any, Database or Program Written File to me that seems to Cause a problem.

* Is this problem Reproduceable?
  If so, Tell me step by step how it happened!

Thats about it! If there is any other information about the Issue, Just mention it and we will see what we can do about it!
